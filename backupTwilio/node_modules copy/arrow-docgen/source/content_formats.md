# Content Formats

	**Supported Types**

	*JSON* - (default) text/javascript or application/javascript
	*XML* - text/xml or application/xml
	*CSV* - text/csv or application/csv
	*YAML* - text/yaml or application/yaml
	*TEXT* - text/plain

This API can generate different content type formats based on standard [HTTP Accept header](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html).

By default, if no _Accept_ header is specified, the content response will be JSON (application/json).  However, you can request a different format by sending an appropriate Accept header in your HTTP request.
