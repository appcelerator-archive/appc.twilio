# Introduction

This API is organized around [REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer). This API is designed to have predictable, resource-oriented URLs and to use HTTP response codes to indicate API errors. We use built-in HTTP features, like HTTP authentication and HTTP verbs, which can be understood by off-the-shelf HTTP clients, and we support cross-origin resource sharing to allow you to interact securely with your API from a client-side application (though you should remember that you should never expose your secret API key in any public website's client code).

This API is running in development mode. When you are ready, you can publish your application to production using the console command `appc publish`.
