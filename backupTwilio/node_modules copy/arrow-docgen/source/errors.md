This API uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate success or failure of the API request. In general, codes in the 2xx range indicate success, codes in the 4xx range indicate an error that resulted from the provided information (e.g. a required parameter was missing, a charge failed, etc.), and codes in the 5xx range indicate an error with your API itself (usually a logic error or programming error).
