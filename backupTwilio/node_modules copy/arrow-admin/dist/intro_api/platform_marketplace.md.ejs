<h1 id="heading-platform-marketplace"><a name="heading-platform-marketplace">Platform Marketplace</a></h1><p>This section provides an overview the <a href="http://software.appcelerator.com">Appcelerator Platform Marketplace</a>.</p>
<h2 id="heading-overview"><a name="heading-overview">Overview</a></h2><p>The Platform Marketplace is a repository of building blocks for both Apps and APIs.  Developers can discover and install components from the Marketplace, and they can also publish new components.  The Platform Marketplace supports setting the access policy of a component. The following access policies are supported:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>public</code>: Everyone can see it (even those outside of your organization).</li>
<li><code>private</code>: Only the publisher see it.  This is the default policy when a component is first published.</li>
<li><code>org</code>: Only certain organizations can see it.  Organizations can be added or removed to/from a component via the <code>appc org</code> command, which is covered later in this section.</li>
<li><code>user_or_org</code>: Only certain organizations or users can see it.  Users can be added or removed to/from a component via the <code>appc user</code> command, which is covered later in this section, and Organizations can be added or removed to/from a component via the <code>appc org</code> command, which is covered later in this section.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can access the Platform Marketplace in the <a href="http://software.appcelerator.com">Appcelerator Platform Marketplace</a> or via the Appcelerator CLI.</p>
<p>To publish something to the Platform Marketplace, you must use the Appcelerator CLI.</p>
<p>Currently, the Platform Marketplace supports the following component types:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Blocks</code>: Used for building APIs</li>
<li><code>Connectors</code>: Used for building APIs</li>
<li><code>Models</code>: Used for building APIs</li>
</ul>
<p>Eventually, it will also support mobile app modules and Alloy widgets.</p>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>publish</td>
<td>None</td>
<td>Publish a component to the Marketplace.  You should run this command from the root directory of your component project.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
