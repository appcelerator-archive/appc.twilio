# Introduction

`<%= objectmodel.metadata.name %>` _<%= objectmodel.metadata.description %>_


This API project is organized around [REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer). This API is designed to have predictable, resource-oriented URLs and to use HTTP response codes to indicate API errors. We use built-in HTTP features, like HTTP authentication and HTTP verbs, which can be understood by off-the-shelf HTTP clients, and we support cross-origin resource sharing to allow you to interact securely with your API from a client-side application (though you should remember that you should never expose your secret API key in any public website's client code).

# Getting started

First, let's explore the directory structure.  The following are the directories that are provided in the default project:

- `apis`: your API files
- `blocks`: your Block files
- `conf`: your configuration files
- `docs`: your API documentation header files
- `logs`: where the server logs will be stored
- `models`: your Model files

In the root directory, you have the following important files:

- `app.js`: the server bootstrap
- `index.js`: provides loading this project as a node module

Both of these files generally should not be modified.

# API definitions

APIs are configured in the `apis` directory.  Each file in this directory should be one API endpoint (however, files starting with `_` will be ignored).  The name of the file is unimportant so name the file something that will make sense to you.

## API Example

The following is an example of an API.

The API first must import the `apibuilder` module using the standard node require.

Next, the API uses the `APIBuilder.API.extend` function to create an API endpoint definition.  This defines the rules for your API.

```javascript
var APIBuilder = require('apibuilder');

var TestAPI = APIBuilder.API.extend({
    name: 'test',
    path: '/test/:id',
    method: 'GET',
    description: 'this is an api that shows how to implement an API',
    model: 'user',
    before: 'pre_example',
    after: 'post_example',
    parameters: {
        id: {description:'the user id'}
    },
    action: function (req, resp, next) {
        // invoke the model find method passing the id parameter
        // stream the result back as response
        resp.stream(req.model.find, req.params.id, next);
    }
});

module.exports = TestAPI;
```

The following properties are supported:

Name         | Required | Description
----------   | -------- | --------------------
name         | true     | API name
path         | true     | Request URI path
method       | true     | HTTP verb such as GET, POST, etc.
description  | true     | Human useful description to display in docs, etc.
model        | true     | The model to use for the response
before       | false    | Either an array or string of the filter to run before the API request is processed
